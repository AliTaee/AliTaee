### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Front-end developer who started learning Web programming back in 2016. Reading the Web sites practicing and learning through the implementation of the projects and new challenges also my daily habits. My career passion is JavaScript, React and user interface and my interests are reading books, music, and photography. The strengths of my work are learning, ideas, user experience (UX), and user interface (UI).
