# Hi there 👋 

## :}
it's my symbol. The bracket } represents code, and combined with colon : it shows happy smiling face of simple developer with 10 years of experience, who admire simple, clean and well-tested code in Front-end development, which I see as a perfect blend of art and technology. While I've primarily worked with React throughout my career, I’m not married to it. In fact HTML, CSS and JavaScript are my main sides of a prism in front-end development, and I'm always open and eager to learn new technologies such as Svelte. I have a keen eye for detail, passion for knowledge sharing, entrepreneur spirit for innovation. I love creating meaningful, interactive user experiences. I enjoy Music, Books, Photography, Board games, Running, and Travel.

I love video games and have recently begun exploring game development. Currently, I'm learning Unity and C# to create my own games.
