## Hi there 👋 

I’m a Senior Front-end Engineer with more than 9 years of experience. I have a self-taught spirit and I have a passion for Front-end Development because for me it’s a combination of art and development. For most of my career, I’ve worked with JavaScript and React but I’m open to learning new technologies. I enjoy helping others, interacting, and getting feedback to improve myself and the project. I enjoy Music, Books, Photography, Board games, Running, and Travel.
