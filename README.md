## Hi there 👋

As a Front-end Developer with more than 4 years of experience in building responsive websites and web
applications, I am always looking for a way to improve my work and team performance, from adding documents
and unit tests to contributing my knowledge and giving feedback in code reviews. I enjoy Music, Photography,
Novels, Travel and Technology.
